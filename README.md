The admin portal should be a web application with working front-end and back-end components. For front-end, make sure all the relevant pages are implemented:
- signup 
- sign in
- homepage
- links 
- You should use proper form validations and display error messages in case of any failure. - 
- create different admins 
- add, remove and modify an admin role 
- add, remove and modify links for admin portal 
- assigning what admin type can access a particular link. 
- All of this should be done using a super admin. New users should sign up using an email address. 
- Once a user signs up on the portal, use super admin to assign an admin role to the new user. A new user should not be able to see any links while waiting for a role to be assigned. 
- For back-end, implement the server and database to get all the necessary data to display for a particular admin. Use a testing strategy during the development of your project and include any automated testing code you write to test components in the deliverable.

For the project demo, make a 5 minutes presentation to discuss 1) software development model you adopted 2) technologies, frameworks and tools you used 3) Testing strategy you adopted and 4) role of each group member (developer, QA etc.) and work each group member did along with a timeline during the project development. You will be required to show working admin portal with fully implemented back-end and front-end components. 

I will not be available in my office hours today, you can contact me by email if you have any questions regarding the project.

Best regards,

All,
I see there was a post from TA regarding the project and demo requirements.

Demo requirements are accurate and you must demo a working product. 

Project description requirements:
Stick to the requirements defined in the project description. 
- It is up to you how you plan to retain the data (TA has suggested using a database). Database is the right technology for this sort of project but there are other ways to achieve this like in memory DB.
- You should test your code with unit tests (this was covered in class lectures)
- Everything this project requires is covered in the class and you should by now have good clarity if you attended the lectures.

What you are demonstrating:
- Your understanding of software engineering principles.
- Team collaboration, communication, testing, and building good quality software.

Please refrain from sending emails stating that you are not CS major. You are in this class and this is a computer science required course. Regardless what your major is, this course requires you to complete course work according to CS curriculum. 
This is why you should have been cautious picking your team members. If you took this class for an easy grade then you are in the wrong class.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good luck with project and demo.
